On the other hand, if you choose a large standard deivation for a precise sensor, then you are are not taking advantage of the precision offered by your sensor and hence may localize poorly (i.e with low confidence). Hence, the noise parameter of the ToF sensor is smaller than that of the odometry (IMU) sensor. The values are in the continous world space and **should be greater than half of the grid cell size**.
