    "The 2d plotting tool is a lightweight process that allows for live asynchronous plotting of multiple scatter plots using Python. The Python API to plot points is described in the Jupyter notebook. It allows you to plot the odometry and ground truth poses. It also allows you to plot the map (as line segments) and robot belief in future labs. Play around with the various GUI buttons to familiarize yourself with the tool.\n",

    "The plotter currently plots points only when the distance between subsequent points sent to it is greater than 0.03 m. This helps limit the number of points plotted. The value can be configured in the plotter config file **plotter_config.ini** present within the scripts folder. \n",
