## Cornell University ECE 4960: Fast Robots

This repository contains the coursework and a student site for [ECE 4960](https://cei-lab.github.io/ECE4960/). The student site is published using [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com).
See [https://kreismit.github.io/ECE4960] for my student landing page.
Also feel free to browse my course notes.

### Code and Files

Since the course is broken up into labs, see the Lab 1 directory for code corresponding to Lab 1, and so on. Each lab lives in its own folder.

### Thanks

Many thanks to [adam-p](https://github.com/adam-p/) for his great [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet). I have referenced this frequently.

Also, credit goes to the [2017 ECE 3400](https://cei-lab.github.io/ece3400-2017/) course site for open-source examples which helped me set up my site.

Finally, here's a shout-out to the _awesome_ [course staff](https://cei-lab.github.io/ECE4960/TeachingTeam/) for ECE 4960!
